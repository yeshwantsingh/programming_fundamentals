## Unit 5: File Handling & OOP Concepts

Work with persistent data storage and introduce object-oriented principles in C.

### Topics Covered:
- **File Handling Basics** (`1_file_handling_basics.c`) - File operations, file pointers, fopen(), fclose()
- **File I/O Operations** (`2_file_io_operations.c`) - fread(), fwrite(), fprintf(), fscanf(); text and binary file handling
- **OOP Concepts** (`3_oop_concepts.cpp`) - Object-oriented programming principles and their application in C/C++

## Learning Path

1. **Start with Unit 1** to build a strong foundation in C syntax and basic operations
2. **Progress to Unit 2** to learn program flow control and function design
3. **Move to Unit 3** to work with structured data types and I/O
4. **Study Unit 4** to master pointers and implement algorithms
5. **Conclude with Unit 5** to learn file handling and advanced concepts

---

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of programming concepts
- A C compiler (gcc, clang, or MSVC)
- A text editor

---

## How to Use These Examples

Each file contains practical examples and exercises. To compile and run:

```bash
gcc filename.c -o output_name
./output_name
```

For more complex programs with multiple files:

```bash
gcc file1.c file2.c -o program_name
./program_name
```

---

## Additional Resources

- Practice implementing variations of the provided examples
- Write your own programs combining concepts from multiple units
- Debug and optimize your code
- Refer to the C Standard Library documentation for built-in functions
